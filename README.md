# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the project 
In this module, we are using ETL method to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the approprriate transformations and loads the data into the tables by connecting with SQL. Using the code we previously created in this module, we refactored it into one function which can take in more files than before. The results from the cleaning data were saved and could be seen in the Resourses folder.
